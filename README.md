### Hi There ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shawn, a Developer based in Toronto 

Life sometimes feel's pretty short, in reality, it's a long journey, so is our career. Here I am, in my current stage, enjoying programming. 

I specialize in Full-stack, and mostly try to build systems/experiences centered around business use-cases, or just simple features that I run into that could be improved upon. I find inspiration from hands-on experiences across different industries.
