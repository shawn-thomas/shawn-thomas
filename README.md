### Hi There ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shawn, a Developer based in Toronto 

Little about me; programming isn't something I came across in my early on. I naturally gravitated towards it through exposure from various stages in my career.

I specialize in Full-stack, and mostly try to build systems/experiences centered around business use-cases, or just simple features that I run into that could be improved upon. I find inspiration from hands-on experiences across different industries.
